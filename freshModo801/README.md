deleteModo801Preferences
========================

Applescript to freshen up modo.
Simply put the application anywhere you would like, then drag a copy of it to the taskbar. I recommend not placing it close to the modo801 application, just to keep from accidentally hitting it, because it will definitely delete your preferences. You can always restore them from the trash can, but that's a hassle.
